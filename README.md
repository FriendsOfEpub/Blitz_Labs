# Blitz_Labs
This is where the fun blitz stuff should have happened (R&amp;D, experiments, etc.) but that never took off, which is why it is now archived.

Please go to the [main Blitz project](https://github.com/FriendsOfEpub/Blitz) to keep up with R&amp;D.

**See `assets` folder for preview.**

Those features might be implemented in Blitz v.1 or v.2. It depends on many factors (LESS’ bloat, unexpected bugs outside official RS support list, etc.) so there is no guarantee we will implement all of them.

## Features being currently tested

- `@supports` for progressive enhancement;
- `initial-letter` for drop-caps;
- custom `list-style-type` with fallback;
- flexbox to align elements vertically on title-page (alternative to `display: table` which proves problematic in legacy RMSDK);
- CSS shapes;
- CSS masking.

## Features which may be tested

- Open type features;
- `monochrome` media query;
- `pointer` and `hover` media queries;
- a media query strategy relying on `height` instead of `width` and/or `aspect-ratio`;
- the JavaScript framework;
- an SVG framework for charts (maybe… not sure at all).

## Stuff likely to happen

- crashing Reading Systems; 
- discovering security holes;
- drinking. A lot.
